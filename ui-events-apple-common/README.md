Shared `no_std` mapping helpers for Apple platform adapters.

This crate owns platform-neutral construction of raw [`ui-events`] building
blocks from values extracted by the AppKit and UIKit adapter crates. It
intentionally does not depend on AppKit, UIKit, or `objc2`, and it does not
decide which platform callbacks should become which high-level events.

## Feature Policy

- `std` is enabled by default.
- `libm` is accepted as a no-op compatibility feature for the workspace
  `no_std` check matrix.

## Helper Groups

- Pointer identity helpers reserve [`PointerId::PRIMARY`] and map platform
  ids through [`PLATFORM_POINTER_ID_OFFSET`].
- Button helpers translate platform button indexes and bitmasks into
  [`PointerButton`] and [`PointerButtons`].
- Modifier helpers build [`Modifiers`] from platform modifier bits.
- [`EventDisposition`] tells responder adapters whether to continue native
  event routing after a host callback.
- State helpers build [`PointerState`] and [`ScrollDelta`] from finite raw
  values already extracted by an adapter crate.
- Text helpers build [`TextInputEvent`] values from UTF-16 ranges used by
  Apple text-input APIs.

These helpers are intentionally small and value-based. AppKit and UIKit
crates still own all Objective-C selector access and platform-specific event
routing.
