AppKit (macOS) adapter using `objc2`.

This crate provides lightweight helpers to convert AppKit events into
[`ui-events`] types, mirroring the style of the `ui-events-web` and
`ui-events-winit` adapters.

It does not provide an `NSView` implementation for you. Instead, your
AppKit view or responder should call these helpers from the corresponding
AppKit callbacks.

Currently supported:

- Pointer (mouse/pen) down/up/move/enter/leave/scroll
- Trackpad gestures: magnify (pinch) and rotate
- Keyboard down/up
- Text-input mapping helpers for committed text, composition updates, and
  UTF-16 replacement ranges
- `AppKitInputResponder`, a reusable `NSResponder` for pointer, scroll,
  gesture, tablet, and keyboard input. Host callbacks return
  [`EventDisposition`] so unhandled events continue through AppKit's normal
  responder chain.
- `AppKitTextInputResponder`, a reusable `NSTextInputClient` responder for
  keyboard, IME, and semantic edit-command callbacks.

`AppKitInputResponder` intentionally does not implement text input, IME, or
edit-command protocols.

## Feature Policy

- `std` is enabled by default.
- `libm` is required for `no_std` builds because tablet tilt orientation uses
  trigonometry.
- With `default-features = false`, the crate remains `no_std` with `alloc`
  and still compiles on non-macOS targets because the `objc2` dependencies
  are behind `target_os = "macos"`.
- On macOS targets, the `objc2*` crates are compiled with their `std` feature
  enabled to support Objective-C runtime integration.
- Defaults avoid pulling in unnecessary APIs by disabling default features
  for `objc2*` crates and enabling only the AppKit symbols this crate uses.

## Pointer Notes

- Pointer positions come from `NSEvent::locationInWindow`, scaled from
  points into physical pixels but not converted into a specific `NSView`.
  `pointer_event_from_nsevent_at_position` accepts a caller-provided
  coordinate, and `AppKitInputResponderHost` requires the host to provide
  the position in its own coordinate space.
- Event timestamps use AppKit's monotonic seconds-since-boot timebase, not
  Unix epoch time.
- Mouse button down/up click counts use AppKit's `clickCount` directly.
  Other pointer event kinds, including scroll events, use `0` without
  querying click metadata from AppKit.
- Mouse events may query AppKit tablet metadata when AppKit reports tablet
  mouse-event subtypes. Scroll events do not query tablet metadata.
- Tablet tilt uses AppKit's `NSEvent::tilt` fractions, where `0.0` is
  perpendicular and `1.0` is parallel to the surface along that axis.

## Scroll Deltas

- Scroll deltas preserve AppKit's `scrollingDeltaX/Y` sign, which already
  reflects the user's natural-scrolling preference and matches the macOS
  path used by `winit`.
- When `hasPreciseScrollingDeltas` is true, deltas map to
  [`ScrollDelta::PixelDelta`]. Otherwise, they map to
  [`ScrollDelta::LineDelta`].

## Gestures

- Magnify gesture events map to [`PointerGesture::Pinch`](ui_events::pointer::PointerGesture::Pinch)
  using AppKit's per-event `magnification` delta.
- Rotate gesture events map to
  [`PointerGesture::Rotate`](ui_events::pointer::PointerGesture::Rotate) in
  clockwise radians.

## Tablet Events

- `NSEventType::TabletPoint` maps to [`PointerType::Pen`] with pressure,
  tangential pressure, and orientation derived from AppKit tilt fractions.
- `NSEventType::TabletProximity` maps to `PointerEvent::Enter` or
  `PointerEvent::Leave` based on `isEnteringProximity`.

## Keyboard Notes

- `flagsChanged` uses aggregate modifier flags. Releasing one side of a
  modifier while the other side remains held may still report the key as
  down until this adapter grows device-dependent left/right modifier masks.

## Text Notes

- [`text`] contains value-based helpers for translating AppKit UTF-16
  location/length pairs and text callbacks into [`TextInputEvent`] values.
- Native callback helpers accept AppKit's `NSString`/`NSAttributedString`,
  `NSRange`, and selector values without making the editor depend on AppKit.
- `text_host` maps synchronous AppKit range, text, geometry, and exact
  hit-test queries onto [`ui_text_input`] capabilities.
- `AppKitInputResponder` remains focused on pointer-like input.
  `AppKitTextInputResponder` owns AppKit's text-input context and forwards
  synchronous IME callbacks to a host implementing the query traits.
- The repository's [`simple_text_appkit`] example is a complete custom text
  editor host with marked text, range conversion, geometry, and hit testing.

## High-Level Helpers

- `AppKitInputResponder`
- `AppKitTextInputResponder`
- `pointer_event_from_nsevent`
- `pointer_event_from_nsevent_at_position`
- `keyboard_event_from_nsevent`
- `insert_text_event_from_nsobject_and_replacement_range`
- `composition_update_event_from_nsobject_and_ranges`
- `edit_command_event_from_selector`
- `text::text_insert_event`
- `text::composition_update_event_with_utf16_ranges`
- `text_host::marked_range_from_host`
- `text_host::first_rect_for_character_range_from_host`

If you prefer, low-level mappers in [`mapping`] let you build events from
raw values (e.g. coordinates, button number, modifier booleans) without
pulling in AppKit types in your own code.

## Minimum supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This version of UI Events AppKit has been verified to compile with **Rust 1.85** and later.

Future versions of UI Events AppKit might increase the Rust version requirement.
It will not be treated as a breaking change and as such can even happen with small patch releases.

<details>
<summary>Click here if compiling fails.</summary>

As time has passed, some UI Events AppKit dependencies could have released versions with a higher Rust requirement.
If you encounter a compilation issue due to a dependency and don't want to upgrade your Rust toolchain, then you could downgrade the dependency.

```sh
# Use the problematic dependency's name and version
cargo update -p package_name --precise 0.1.1
```
