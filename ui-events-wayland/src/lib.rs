//! Bridges Wayland input into the [`ui-events`] model.
//!
//! This crate is Linux-only in practice. The `wayland-client` protocol bindings
//! it builds on are depended upon only on `cfg(target_os = "linux")` targets,
//! and the stateful reducers that consume them are gated the same way. On every
//! other target the crate compiles to an essentially empty library, so it can
//! live in a cross-platform workspace without pulling in platform dependencies.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! - [`mapping`] holds platform-neutral, value-based conversions from Wayland
//!   input primitives (evdev button codes, surface-local coordinates, axis
//!   values, modifier booleans) into [`ui-events`] building blocks. It is
//!   always compiled, performs no foreign-function calls, and references no
//!   `wayland-client` types, so its unit tests run on every target.
//! - Stateful reducers that consume `wayland-client` event streams are gated to
//!   `cfg(target_os = "linux")` and build on these helpers.
//! - [`text_input`] provides platform-neutral text-input-v3 values: bounded
//!   surrounding text, content type, cursor rectangles, and ordered `done`
//!   batches. Proxy focus, commit serials, and double-buffered lifecycle remain
//!   the responsibility of a stateful Wayland integration.
//!
//! ## Coordinates, scale, and time
//!
//! Wayland delivers surface-local pointer coordinates as logical (post-scale)
//! `f64` values. Callers supply a `scale_factor` (for example from
//! `wp_fractional_scale_v1`'s preferred scale divided by 120, or an output's
//! integer scale), and these helpers multiply by it to produce the physical
//! pixels [`ui-events`] expects.
//!
//! Reducers built on these helpers take a caller-provided monotonic nanosecond
//! timestamp for the pointer [`PointerState`], rather than Wayland's 32-bit
//! millisecond event timestamps, so input shares one clock domain with frame
//! sampling and timers.
//!
//! ## Resolving logical keys
//!
//! The keyboard reducer resolves the physical key code of every key event with
//! no system dependencies. Enabling the non-default `xkb` feature additionally
//! links `libxkbcommon` and uses the compositor's keymap to resolve logical key
//! values, typed text, and the authoritative modifier set (including the lock
//! states and Alt Graph).
//!
//! ## Feature policy
//!
//! - `std` is enabled by default.
//! - `no_std` builds require `libm`, which supplies the trigonometry the tablet
//!   and touch mapping use.
//! - `xkb` reads the compositor keymap through `std::fs`, so it implies `std`.
//!
