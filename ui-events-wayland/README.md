Bridges Wayland input into the [`ui-events`] model.

This crate is Linux-only in practice. The `wayland-client` protocol bindings
it builds on are depended upon only on `cfg(target_os = "linux")` targets,
and the stateful reducers that consume them are gated the same way. On every
other target the crate compiles to an essentially empty library, so it can
live in a cross-platform workspace without pulling in platform dependencies.

## Architecture

- [`mapping`] holds platform-neutral, value-based conversions from Wayland
  input primitives (evdev button codes, surface-local coordinates, axis
  values, modifier booleans) into [`ui-events`] building blocks. It is
  always compiled, performs no foreign-function calls, and references no
  `wayland-client` types, so its unit tests run on every target.
- Stateful reducers that consume `wayland-client` event streams are gated to
  `cfg(target_os = "linux")` and build on these helpers.
- [`text_input`] provides platform-neutral text-input-v3 values: bounded
  surrounding text, content type, cursor rectangles, and ordered `done`
  batches. Proxy focus, commit serials, and double-buffered lifecycle remain
  the responsibility of a stateful Wayland integration.

## Coordinates, scale, and time

Wayland delivers surface-local pointer coordinates as logical (post-scale)
`f64` values. Callers supply a `scale_factor` (for example from
`wp_fractional_scale_v1`'s preferred scale divided by 120, or an output's
integer scale), and these helpers multiply by it to produce the physical
pixels [`ui-events`] expects.

Reducers built on these helpers take a caller-provided monotonic nanosecond
timestamp for the pointer [`PointerState`], rather than Wayland's 32-bit
millisecond event timestamps, so input shares one clock domain with frame
sampling and timers.

## Resolving logical keys

The keyboard reducer resolves the physical key code of every key event with
no system dependencies. Enabling the non-default `xkb` feature additionally
links `libxkbcommon` and uses the compositor's keymap to resolve logical key
values, typed text, and the authoritative modifier set (including the lock
states and Alt Graph).

## Feature policy

- `std` is enabled by default.
- `no_std` builds require `libm`, which supplies the trigonometry the tablet
  and touch mapping use.
- `xkb` reads the compositor keymap through `std::fs`, so it implies `std`.

## Minimum supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This version of UI Events Wayland has been verified to compile with **Rust 1.85** and later.

Future versions of UI Events Wayland might increase the Rust version requirement.
It will not be treated as a breaking change and as such can even happen with small patch releases.

As time has passed, some UI Events Wayland dependencies could have released versions with a higher Rust requirement.
If you encounter a compilation issue due to a dependency and don't want to upgrade your Rust toolchain, then you could downgrade the dependency.

```sh
# Use the problematic dependency's name and version
cargo update -p package_name --precise 0.1.1
```
