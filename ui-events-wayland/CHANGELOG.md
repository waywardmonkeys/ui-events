# Changelog

UI Events Wayland has not yet been published.

## [Unreleased]

This release has an [MSRV][] of 1.85.

The crate is `no_std` (using `alloc`); enabling the `xkb` feature additionally
requires `std`.

### Added

- Value-level text-input-v3 helpers for bounded surrounding text, content type,
  cursor geometry, and ordered `done` event batches.

- Platform-neutral Wayland input mapping helpers in the `mapping` module:
  evdev pointer-button mapping, surface-local coordinate scaling, scroll-axis
  frame to `ScrollDelta` conversion, pointer and touch identity helpers, touch
  contact-geometry and orientation conversions, modifier helpers, an evdev
  keyboard scancode to physical-key `Code` mapping, XKB keysym to named-key and
  logical-key mapping, physical-`Code` to key-location mapping, a keymap-active
  modifiers to modifier-set helper, pinch scale-fraction and rotation
  conversions, and tablet-tool helpers (stylus-button mapping, tool-type to
  pointer-type and tip-button mapping, normalized pressure and slider
  conversions, and tilt-to-orientation conversion).
- `pointer::PointerEventReducer`, which reduces a `wl_pointer` event stream into
  `PointerEvent`s, accumulating frame-batched scroll axes, tracking button and
  click-count state, and stamping a caller-provided monotonic timestamp.
- `touch::TouchEventReducer`, which reduces a `wl_touch` event stream into touch
  `PointerEvent`s, tracking each contact's state, frame-batching shape and
  orientation updates, mapping the lowest active contact to the primary pointer,
  and stamping a caller-provided monotonic timestamp.
- `gesture::PinchGestureReducer`, which reduces a `zwp_pointer_gesture_pinch_v1`
  touchpad pinch event stream into pinch and rotate `PointerEvent`s, converting
  Wayland's absolute scale into a per-update scale fraction and its
  clockwise-degree rotation into radians.
- `tablet::TabletToolReducer`, which reduces a `zwp_tablet_tool_v2` event stream
  into pen `PointerEvent`s, frame-batching the tool's position and pressure,
  tilt, and slider axes, mapping the tip and stylus barrel buttons (an eraser
  tool's tip to the pen-eraser button), surfacing proximity as enter and leave,
  and stamping a caller-provided monotonic timestamp.
- `keyboard::KeyboardEventReducer`, which reduces a `wl_keyboard` event stream
  into `KeyboardEvent`s, mapping each evdev scancode to its physical W3C `Code`
  and key state, self-tracking the modifier set from the physical modifier keys,
  seeding pressed-key state on focus enter, and exposing the key-repeat
  parameters. Logical key values and typed text require the `xkb` feature.
- An optional, non-default `xkb` feature for `keyboard::KeyboardEventReducer`
  that links `libxkbcommon` and uses the compositor's keymap to resolve logical
  key values, typed text, the key location, and the authoritative modifier set
  (including the lock states and the Alt Graph modifier).
- `seat::SeatReducer`, which aggregates a seat's pointer, keyboard, and touch
  reducers behind its `wl_seat` capabilities, routing each device's events into
  a uniform `SeatEventTranslation` stream and dropping a device's reducer when
  its capability is withdrawn.
